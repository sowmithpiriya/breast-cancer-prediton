🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in increasing survival rates.
This project focuses on building a machine learning–based breast cancer prediction system that classifies tumors as benign or malignant using clinical features.

The model is trained on a publicly available dataset and evaluated using standard performance metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze breast cancer diagnostic data

Perform data preprocessing and feature scaling

Train multiple machine learning models

Evaluate and compare model performance

Predict whether a tumor is Benign (B) or Malignant (M)
